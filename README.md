elvis: API samples
=======================================

These samples demonstrate various ways in which you can use the elvis API.

We encourage you to download the samples and customize them. They can provide a good starting point to build your own interfaces and apps on top of elvis. If you want to contribute improvements or new samples back to the community, send us a patch or contact us at: [www.dutchsoftware.com](http://www.dutchsoftware.com)

All the samples are open-source and licensed under the MIT License so you can use the code in your own projects and change it as much as you need.


Demo
--------
An online demo version of these samples can be found at: [demo.elviscloud.com](http://demo.elviscloud.com)


Use them yourself
--------
To use the samples on your own elvis server, place them in the "<config>/html_public" folder of your elvis server. They will then be available on the following url: http://<yourserver>/controller/html_public/...

Some of the samples auto-login using the 'guest' user. You will have to either change that, or enable the guest user in "<config>/internal-users.properties.txt" and setup appropriate permissions for that user in elvis.
